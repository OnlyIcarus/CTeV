                <p><b>Who are we?</b> <br><br>

                    Meet our team and our family <br><br>
                    
                    In 2017, Eloise was born with bilateral CTEV. As her treatment journey unfolded, our family became involved in research, understanding the condition and the shortfall in treatment options. We feel that more can be done to help CTEV-affected children and young adults, using technology to improve access to treatment and their quality of life. 
                    
                </p>
    
                <p> <b>Dr. Lorna McHattie</b> <br><br>
                    
                    Dr Lorna McHattie is a public health researcher and grandmother to Eloise. <br><br>

                    Lorna has been evaluating studies about the treatment of CTEV and is passionate that any development of a new treatment is based on scientific evidence and, just as importantly, in collaboration with CTEV-affected families.
                    
                </p>

                <p><b>Catriona Riddoch</b> <br><br>
                    
                    Catriona Riddoch is a lawyer and mother of Eloise. <br><br>

                   Catriona has been searching for innovative treatments for CTEV and has found social media useful for connecting with other families.
